### Additional Information:
Make sure to review the course materials regularly and participate in the Friday discussions. This course will also provide opportunities to delve into state-of-the-art methods and apply them in practical settings. 

To successfully complete the course, each group (up to 2 members) must work on a practical project. Project proposals will be discussed in May and the final presentation will take place in September.
